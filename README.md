## Pomodoro Timer
  Allowes users to set a timer to help manage time for studying and break times. Based on the pomodoro technique created by italian inventor Francesco Cirillo. Having predetermined study and break times allows for more efficient time management, rest and creativity. A progress bar tracks the progress for each study and break session, as well as audio alerts when transition from one session to another.

## Tech Stack
Javascript, React, Bootstrap

## Improvements
Due to the nature of the project I used minimal styling, and would like to enhance it. I would also like to add a drop down menu to select difference music for each focus and break session. Currently the focus session can only be modified by 5 minute increments and I think it would offer the user more functionality to make 1 minute increments.
